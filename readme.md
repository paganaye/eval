Eval 
====

Eval aim is to create a language to build websites.

It is nowhere near to be available for public release.


I would be quite surprised to get anyone involved at this stage. If you want to contribute though please feel free to contact me (pascal ganaye).

The first thing we need is a good unique name for this language.


There are some design documents in the docs folder.
