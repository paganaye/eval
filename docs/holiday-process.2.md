# Holiday Process II

I have made some progress on the JSON display area.

I am wondering how hard it would be to make a holiday request website using the current framework and fix as I go along.

First I need employees.

    #update table holidays
        employee string
        holidayUsed number defaultValue 0
        holidayPending number defaultValue 0
        holidayLeft number defaultValue 25
    

Then we can edit our first user

    #update holidays pascal
        name pascal
        holidayUsed number
        holidayPending number
        holidayLeft number default value 25
    

What next?

We need an array of requests. This doesn't exist yet.
