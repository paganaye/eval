# Holiday Process II

I have made some progress on the JSON display area.

I am wondering how hard it would be to make a holiday request website using the current framework and fix as I go along.

First I need users.

    #update table user
        name string
        holidayUsed number defaultValue 0
        holidayPending number defaultValue 0
        holidayLeft number defaultValue 25
    

Then we can edit our first user

    #update user pascal
        name pascal
        holidayUsed 0
        holidayPending 0
        holidayLeft 25
    

What next?

We need an array of requests. This doesn't exist yet.
